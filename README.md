Live site: https://moonwalkie.github.io/tasty-recipes/

## Overview

A few of the tastiest, weirdest and wildest recipes I have found from around the world. 
This assignment is part of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> curriculum. The main objective was to make a basic website with 3 recipe pages.

## Objectives

1. Create a new directory within the odin-recipes directory and name it recipes.
2. Create a new HTML file within the recipes directory and name it after the recipe it will contain.
3. For now, just include an h1 heading with the recipe’s name as its content.
4. An image of the finished dish under the h1 heading that you added earlier.
5. Under the image, it should have an appropriately sized “Description” heading followed by a paragraph or two describing the recipe.
6. Under the description, add an “Ingredients” heading followed by an unordered list of the ingredients needed for the recipe.
7. Finally, under the ingredients list, add a “Steps” heading followed by an ordered list of the steps needed for making the dish.
8. Add two more recipes with identical page structures to the recipe page you’ve already created.
