        <h3>When are plagues of locusts not considered a nuisance? When they're a local delicacy, of course!</h3>
            <p>Well, plagues of anything will always be a nuisance, but at least this one doubles as a crunchy, Kosher snack too.
            <br>
            Locusts are the only insect considered Kosher and are a major source of protein - so Israelis kill two birds with one stone by eradicating these pests by eating them.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>About 25 locusts</li>
            </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Have ready about <strong>2 liters</strong> of vegetable stock (or 10 cups) with a little <em>turmeric</em> added to it.</li>

                <li>Throw the locusts in the <em>boiling stock</em>, whole. Cook for about <strong>3 minutes</strong>.</li>

                <li>Drain the locusts and let them cool somewhat.</li>

                <li>Twist off their <strong>heads</strong>: this will also pull out the black, threadlike <em>viscera</em>.</li>

                <li>Remove the <em>wings</em> and <em>small legs</em>.</li>

                <li>Make a seasoned flour with:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>4 tablespoons</strong> any  flour</li> 
                        <li><strong>3/4 teaspoon</strong> salt</li>
                        <li>A little <strong>pepper</strong> and <strong>chili powder</strong></li> 
                        <li>A shake of <strong>ground coriander</strong></li>
                        <li>Dried <strong>garlic granules</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Roll the pre-cooked locusts in a <strong>beaten whole egg</strong>, then roll them in the <em>seasoned flour</em>. Shake excess flour off.</li>

                <li>Fry in olive oil for <strong>1 1/2-2 minutes</strong>, till color turns <em>golden brown</em>.</li>

                <li>Serve with a lemony <em>tahini sauce</em>, or a <em>za'atar pesto</em> made more lemony than usual.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Crunch! Enjoy!</p>
