        <h3>Want to get over your fear of spiders? How about eating them for lunch?</h3>
            <p>Tarantulas were first introduced as food under the communist regime in the country in the 70s, when people were starving and had nothing else to eat.
            <br> 
            This became more and more popular, and today you will be served deep fried tarantulas all over Cambodia. It is said that they taste a bit like crab.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul class="lists">
                <li>2 cups canola or vegetable oil</li>
                <li>2 frozen adult Texas brown, Chilean rose, or similar-sized tarantulas, thawed</li>
                <li>1 cup tempura batter</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol class="lists">
                <li>In a <em>deep saucepan</em> or <em>deep-fat fryer</em>, heat the oil to <strong>350°F.</strong></li>

                <li>With a <em>sharp knife</em>, sever and discard the <strong>abdomens</strong> from the two tarantulas. Singe off any of the spider's body hairs with a <em>crème brûlée torch</em> or <em>butane cigarette lighter</em>.</li>

                <li>Dip each spider into the tempura batter to <strong>thoroughly coat</strong>. Use a <em>slotted spoon</em> or your hands to make sure each spider is <strong>spread-eagled</strong> (so to speak) and not clumped together before dropping it into the hot oil.</li>

                <li>Deep-fry the spiders, <strong>one at a time</strong>, until the batter is <em>lightly browned</em>, about <strong>1 minute</strong>. Remove each spider from the oil and place it on <em>paper towels</em> to drain.</li>

                <li>Use a <em>sharp knife</em> to cut each spider in two <strong>lengthwise</strong>. Sprinkle with the paprika and serve. Encourage your guests to try the <em>legs</em> first and, if still hungry, to nibble on the meat-filled <em>mesothorax</em>, avoiding the spider's <em>paired fangs</em>, which are tucked away in the head region.</li>
